      <h1>Sarah Hershenhouse</h1>
      <p>My name is Sarah Hershenhouse, and currently I'm a bartender.
        All of my jobs thus far have been customer service oriented,
        and I've been wanting to learn some kind of actually useful skill
        that would land me a good job. Upon doing some research, I discovered
        web development and decided I wanted to give it a try because 
        it seemed more interesting than anything else I'd found. So far, I'm 
        really enjoying the course. One of my goals in life is to be able to 
        live a comfortable life and not have to worry about money while being 
        self-sustainable. To me, the thought of not having to rely on anyone else
        seems very comforting. Of course, I'd still like to have people in my life 
        that I can trust to be there for me. 
        My hope is to finish this course and become a full time Web Developer.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong> <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
